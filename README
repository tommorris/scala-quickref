Scala QuickRef
==============

I want one. Other people want one. So let's write one. A quickref is a "dense
but easy navigated guides provide easily forgotten information about the most
frequently used features of a language" (Payne, 2009)

Please report omissions and errors to <tom@tommorris.org> or to my GitHub
issue tracker. Or just, y'know, fix 'em and send a patch.

STYLE
-----
English please. Except where it's Scala or XHTML. HTML/XML encode Unicode
characters.

Please be concise. This is Scala, not Java. ;-)

Please use two space soft tab indents. Consider html, head and body outside of
the indentation hierarchy.

Feel free to hyperlink to particularly useful further reading after each
section.

Limit line length to 80.

If you need to assign class names or IDs, please use lower-case semantic,
(non-presentational) class names and IDs. Don't use Hungarian notation.
Separate multiple words with hyphens (e.g. "regex-syntax").

FUN
---
If you are working on the QuickRef, add any music you are funking out to our
collaborative Spotify playlist. :-)
